different kinds of data: unstructured text from the wild web, relational datasets from commercial providers, semi-structured data from public apis. on a practical level, whether we\u2019re working with social media data or corporate entity data, we\u2019re generally looking for ways to make it easier for client-side folks to do what they already do - look up data, draw connections, anticipate shifts and changes, make hard business decisions - but make it faster, easier, smarter, and more scalable. we leverage libraries from python and r, tools like spark and hadoop, and a range of different sql and nosql databases to do that, though we\u2019re fairly open-minded in terms of stack (well, we do have a strong preference for open source).\nwho we\u2019re looking for\nfirst off, you\u2019re a u.s. citizen and able to work in the u.s.; this is non-negotiable due to the contracts we work on. it would be best if you reside in the dc/md/va commuting area, but we can make a remote arrangement work if necessary.\nyou have extensive experience working with data, and you\u2019re comfortable with structured and unstructured data (html, xml, json, csv).\nyou don\u2019t have a dog in the sql/nosql fight - you believe in picking the best tool for the job, and you\u2019ve used enough of both to have good instincts about what will work best to solve the problem at hand.\nyou\u2019ve been doing object-oriented programming for a while (4+ years), and you know python/r well enough to hit the ground running on day one.\nyou have a grasp of machine learning and you\u2019re game to help us find smart ways to implement/integrate data science features (e.g. machine learning models) within a java- and angular-based software application.\nyou have experience with agile software development, know about sprints, scrum, and all that stuff, and you aren\u2019t squeamish about code reviews or rubber ducking.\nyou understand why version control is important to data science and are willing to using git branching conventions in a routine, methodical, communicative, and participatory way.\n\nthings that are nice to have:\n a phd or some other advanced degree. if you have one, that\u2019s cool (some of us do, too).\nother fancy credentials, certificates, badges, hackerrank or kaggle scores, etc.\nyour ability to implement a binary search tree or fizzbuzz on a whiteboard

detect issues, reduce noise, resolve issues faster, and continuously improve their own practices. work our team has shipped includes nrql query facet suggestion, outlier alerting, error profiles, and time series baseline alerting.\ndata scientist means many things to many people, we mean a solid foundation in statistics and machine learning, and the ability to pragmatically apply both to real world problems that we ourselves ship to production.\nwhat working on the team is like:\nwe sit together as a team, and have on the spot discussions as a team as-needed.\nwe support each other, both inside and across teams.\nwe often take on projects with goals that may turn out to be unachievable. this is different to pure engineering teams that are mostly about shipping solutions that you know can be built.\nwe are unusual with our data science problems in that we have to deliver solutions for datasets that we may only have eyeballed a small subset of the data for. i.e. we may iterate based on a sampling of customers data but it has to work well for entire customer base.\nwe deal with a lot of roadmap uncertainty. we organize our projects so that we can conclude an approach won\u2019t work, scrap the project, and switch gears.\nwe almost always include elements of statistics in our work. so our solutions are often probabilistic in nature.\nwe focus on delivering production code at a regular cadence using agile techniques.\nwe deal with extremely high volumes of data so all of our services have to scale well and be operationally robust.\nwe are on-call for the services we ship (we own them!), so we\u2019re very operationally minded.\nwe predominantly work on the backend, but will do front end work as needed.\nwe commonly use docker, kafka, java, kotlin, and expose graphql apis.\nto join this team, you must:\nbe able to engineer code following best practices and work in modern engineering environments.\nbe able to level up the team through your depth of understanding of statistics and machine learning (mostly the former), and your ability to apply statistics to real world problems (especially time series data).\nbe able to communicate ideas effectively and collaborate on problem solving.\nexample statistics problems you must be able to contribute meaningfully towards:\nnon-exponential-smoothing approaches to central-tendency for univariate time series data. solutions need to work in a streaming fashion on large volumes of data, and with both memory and time constraints.\ncounter-factual analysis of systems given uncontrolled observational data. solutions need to work in an ad-hoc on-demand fashion.\noutlier detection in time series data that can discover correlations (hopefully causal) in related time series. solutions need to work in a streaming fashion on large volumes of data, and with both memory and time constraints.\nyou\u2019ll love working with us the most if:\nyou are comfortable with a blend of pure engineering,

with strategy because we don\u2019t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. we often could speak to a cfo or head of underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline \u2013 in terms they can understand \u2013 why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. if we step across to the devops lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about apache committers, osf, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. we\u2019re not trying to boil the ocean. we want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. we have a lot of fun together. most people join here and stay here for the people. that said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. i have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here\u2019s a suggestion \u2013 if you love cloud computing for big data and/or advanced analytics, machine learning, etc we should talk.\n\nclarity insights is an equal employment opportunity employer. we believe in treating
