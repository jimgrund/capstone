Commonly referred to as big data, this rapid growth and storage creates opportunities for collection, processing and analysis of structured and unstructured data. Financial services, in particular, have widely adopted big data analytics to inform better investment decisions with consistent returns. In conjunction with big data, algorithmic trading uses vast historical data with complex mathematical models to maximize portfolio returns. The continued adoption of big data will inevitably transform the landscape of financial services. However, along with its apparent benefits, significant challenges remain in regards to big data’s ability to capture the mounting volume of data. The increasing volume of market data poses a big challenge for financial institutions. Along with vast historical data, banking and capital markets need to actively manage ticker data. Likewise, investment banks and asset management firms use voluminous data to make sound investment decisions.

125,COMS W4995,Topics in Computer Science: Causal Inference for Data Science,"Data scientists often have to answer questions that will lead to decisions about actions a company might take. Often, they will be able to run an experiment, and see the effect the decision might have by testing it first. Other times, they will only have observational data at their disposal. In both cases, they need to infer the causal effect of an action on some outcomes of interest. Causal inference is an essential skill for a data scientist. Without a proper understanding, potential biases as large as 1000% have been observed in practice! This course will cover the basics of the potential outcomes framework, the Pearlian framework, and a collection of methods for observational and experimental causal inference. We'll use examples from industry applications throughout the course, especially focused on web applications.",Columbia,"New York City, New York","computer, science, causal, inference, science",11,Parallel Computing,8,HPC

127,ECON 293,Machine Learning and Causal Inference,"This course will cover statistical methods based on the machine learning literature that can be used for causal inference. In economics and the social sciences more broadly, empirical analyses typically estimate the effects of counterfactual policies, such as the effect of implementing a government policy, changing a price, showing advertisements, or introducing new products. This course will review when and how machine learning methods can be used for causal inference, and it will also review recent modifications and extensions to standard methods to adapt them to causal inference and provide statistical theory for hypothesis testing. We consider causal inference methods based on randomized experiments as well as observational studies, including methods such as instrumental variables and those based on longitudinal data. We consider the estimation of average treatment effects as well as personalized policies. Lectures will focus on theoretical developments, while classwork will consist primarily of empirical applications of the methods.

So, enterprises worldwide, big and small, are moving toward cloud-computing solutions for meeting their computing needs, including the use of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).
