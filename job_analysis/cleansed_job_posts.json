community is at an auspicious turning point in history. thanks to the success of the past few decades and favorable economic growth, developing countries now have an unprecedented opportunity to end extreme poverty within a generation. this is the vision of the wbg: to eradicate extreme poverty by reducing the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day to 3 percent by 2030 and promote shared prosperity by fostering the income growth of the bottom 40 percent in every country.\nto achieve this vision, the wbg board of governors has approved a strategy for the organization. this strategy leverages, for the first time, the combined strength of the wbg institutions and their unique ability to partner with the public and private sectors to deliver customized development solutions backed by finance, world class knowledge and convening services. the strategy has three components: (1) maximizing development impact by engaging country clients in identifying and tackling the most difficult development challenges; (2) promoting scaled-up partnerships that are strategically aligned with the goals; and (3) crowding in public and private resources, expertise and ideas.\nthe architecture underpinning the strategy and instrumental to its success is the establishment of fourteen global practices and five global themes that, in concert with the wbg regions, will design solutions that address clients\u2019 most pressing developmental challenges, and ultimately, enable the wbg to meet its twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.\norganizational context\nlike most organizations in the 21st century, the world bank is knowledge-intensive. our experience and expertise are our products, delivered through project implementation insights from supervision reports as well as well as thought-provoking analytical work. in both our country offices and corporate offices reside individuals who are sought-after experts in their field and who are contributing daily to the bank\u2019s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity for all. the bank has a 70+ year history of gathering and storing the output of efforts to further the development agenda. we attract the best and brightest; recruited to work alongside equally bright individuals. providing those individuals with strong infrastructure and support to manage knowledge so that they can concentrate on delivering quality and outstanding service to our country clients is deckm\u2019s commitment.\nunit context\nthe development economics knowledge management is a cross-cutting area within the world bank, working across 14 global practices, 5 cross-cutting solution areas, 6 regions and corporate functions. deckm takes the lead in ensuring operational knowledge flows across operations in support of the bank\u2019s development agenda.\nas a newly formed unit within development economics (dec), deckm continues to build its program of services and offerings. the functions that make up deckm include:\ntext/data analytics: offering up insights through text and data analytics and capturing, curating and disseminating knowledge through research, literature reviews to support decision-making by both operations staff and senior management.\nknowledge management: ensuring operational knowledge is flowing across operations; including country management units, global practices and global themes in support of the bank\u2019s development agenda;\nlearning: ensuring operational best practices and lessons learned are captured in our learning curriculum to be delivered via our open learning campus platform;\nglobal delivery initiative: collaboratively creating a collective and cumulative evidence base of delivery of know-how (global delivery initiative) to inform development practice and improve implementation results.\nsouth-south exchange facility: an integrated knowledge sharing approach to transfer knowledge from one country to another.\nbackground & general description:\nthis role leads both a function and a team within the bank that uses technology to identify patterns, draw insights from text and data, uses predictive analytics to assist in decision-making and develops the algorithms powering machine learning. it also includes extracting from various available archived documents relevant tacit knowledge insights on topics that could enrich the project design , delivery and implementation process by bank teams. the technical solutions developed by this team will help to address business and knowledge-related issues experienced by, primarily but not limited to, our operations group. this important role will lead the tda team in working with cutting edge technologies

$67 billion in loans, grants, equity investments and guarantees to its members and private businesses, of which $24 billion was concessional finance to its poorest members. it is governed by 188-member countries and delivers services out of 120 offices with nearly 15,000 staff located globally.\n\nthe wbg consists of five specialized institutions: the international bank for reconstruction and development (ibrd), the international development association (ida), the international finance corporation (ifc), the multilateral investment guarantee agency (miga), and the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes (icsid). the world bank is organized into six client-facing regional vice-presidencies, several corporate functions and thirteen global practices to bring best-in-class knowledge and solutions to regional and country clients.\n\npoverty and equity global practice\n\nthe poverty and equity gp, part of the efi cluster of global practices, plays three key \u2013leading and supportive\u2013 roles: sectoral integrator at country level; generator of knowledge and dialogue; and operational solutions supporter. the country-level work of the poverty and equity global practice typically falls under one or more of the following three streams:\n\nlaying the foundations for evidence-based policy by strengthening data on household welfare: this is the foundational work, mostly delivered through ta and occasionally through statistical capacity-building investment operations, to support the design and implementation of household surveys, provide advice on best-practice methodologies for estimating household welfare, poverty, and shared prosperity, and build capacity and strengthen country systems for collecting data on and monitoring household welfare.\ndefining the agenda through integrative analysis and dialogue: this stream of work has focused on using the household-level data, wherever available, to undertake integrative analyses to inform the policy dialogue and advance the poverty reduction and shared prosperity agenda and priorities at the regional, national and occasionally sub-national levels.\ndelivering operational solutions: this stream of work focuses on collaborating with internal and external partners to translate the upstream analytics into concrete implementable measures and support the implementation of particular interventions aimed at reducing poverty. this includes supporting the preparation of systematic country diagnostics and country partnership frameworks, as well as the analysis of poverty and social impacts of bank operations.\nthe poverty global practice is organized by both region and thematic line, with regions managed by a practice manager. the development and flow of global knowledge within the practice is facilitated through four cross-cutting thematic lines, each of which is led by a thematic lead economist. these are:\n\n(1) poverty monitoring and statistical capacity building; (2) markets and institutions for poverty reduction and shared prosperity; (3) fiscal and social policy for poverty reduction and shared prosperity; and (4) managing risks for poverty reduction and shared prosperity. every member of the practice is affiliated with and participates in and contributes to the work of at least one of the thematic lines. in addition, the practice takes the lead in two corporate priority areas: (a) data for goals; and (b) systematic country diagnostics.\n\ndata for goals\n\nembedded in the poverty and equity global practice, data for goals (d4g) is a team of data scientists and economists tasked with monitoring the world bank group\u2019s (wbg) twin goals. the d4g team is responsible for developing tools, systems and protocols, in partnership with its, dec teams, and the regional teams for statistical development, to automate and ease the workflow for the production of the global and regional poverty and shared prosperity monitoring of the world bank. these data collections managed by the d4g team include the global monitoring database (gmd) which are used to produce regional and global poverty estimates and inform high profile corporate products such wdi, poverty and shared prosperity report (pspr) and the corporate scorecard (csc).in addition, the team is also responsible for the regular analytical products such as macro-poverty projections, corporate score card indicators and global topical reports such as global profiles of poor, shared prosperity, at a glance notes etc., as well as to provide just-in-time requests to support and leverage the work of the poverty gp poverty economists.\n\nthe d4g program is guided by the following principles:\n\n1. addressing world bank group\u2019s commitment to monitor global poverty and shared prosperity by providing essential inputs to the poverty updates (such as the 2020 update), the poverty and shared prosperity report, and other corporate products.\n\n2. introducing innovations and technologies in welfare measurement and monitoring to amplify the impact of the wbg\u2019s thought leadership in poverty and inequality measurement.\n\n3. increasing efficiency and exploiting economies of scale (coordination/collaboration and systems) by integrating regional teams within poverty gp and engaging other colleagues such as the global solutions group 1 (gsg1), the development data and research group (decdg/rg) teams.\n\n4. promoting data access and use through data generation, harmonization, management and improved access by maintaining and creating wbg data platforms.\n\nthe poverty & equity gp is looking for a data scientist, based in washington dc, to join sar/mna regional unit, and also contribute to the d4g program.\n\nduties and accountabilities\n\nthe selected candidate will be based in washington, dc. the practice is seeking to recruit a data scientist with knowledge and experience in social sector
